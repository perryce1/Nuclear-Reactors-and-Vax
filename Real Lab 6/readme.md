# United States Covid Vaccinations 2020-2023 and Nuclear Reactor Locations
## This map shows a map of the United States and a state-by-state break down of Covid vaccinations per 100 people of the years 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023.
I am a student at App State and I created this map for a class project. I grew up close to Shearon Harris, a Nuclear Reactor plant in central NC. I thought it would be interesting to view the locations of all reactors in the country and overlay it with something completely unrelated such as Covid vaccinations.
